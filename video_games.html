    <h2>Genres and Activities</h2>
    <p>I mainly play video games and try to explore a multitude of genres to enjoy and experience. I play RPGs(JRPG's mainly), strategy titles,FPS and many others. </p>
	
	<h3>Pokemon Tournaments</h3>

    <p>I play and host online pokemon tournaments for fun. Using an online format we play a multitude of generations(older and newer pokemon main titles) and play in single battles of 6v6(6 pokemon per player). The format most commonly used would be similar to fantasy leagues but more hands on as you can use and customize the pokemon for your opponent specifically on a game to game basis. It's a fun way to add some competitive aspects to a game that many people enjoy.</p>

	<h3>Strategy Games</h3>
    <img id="header" src="images/strategy.jpg" alt="Star Wars Empire At War">
    <p>When I was young I got introduced to many classic tactical games like Total War:Medival 2 and the rest of the franchise. This grew my love for further tactical games that lead me to explore older and newer strategic games. One game I have enjoyed more recently has been Star Wars Empire At War which has a Star Wars twist to the strategy genre with ground battle and space battles with their respective units.</p>

	<h3>FPS Games</h3>
    <img id="header" src="images/fps.jpg" alt="Valorant & Overwatch">
    <p>While this is not my favorite genre I do play Valorant and Overwatch and try to improve when I have the time. I am fairly competitive and enjoy playing against others to improve and play against better players.</p>
	
	<h3>Story Games</h3>
    <img id="header" src="images/story.jpg" alt="Yakuza 0">
    <p>While this is the most vague genre it fills in the remaining interests where a multitude of genres culiminate to make a game that follows a standard flow that is similar to a movie. A game I played through recently with a large story was Yakuza 0 and the joy of it was having the options of a game, such as minigames and sidequests, with the narrative of a feature length film or TV show that kept me entertained for the entire 70+ hour experience. Alongside Yakuza 0, I've played RPG's like Chrono Trigger and Mass Effect.</p>
